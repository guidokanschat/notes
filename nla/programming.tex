\section{Programming with Armadillo}

Armadillo is a readily available library providing matrix and vector
classes. We recommend it, because it is simple to use yet offers a lot
of functionality which makes implementing in a structured way possible
and easy.

Armadillo can be found at \url{https://arma.sourceforge.net/} and is
available as installable package for many operating systems. Be aware
that some of them distinguish between the library itself and the
development version. You need the latter, as it includes the header
files.

\begin{Example*}{armadillo-matmult}{Armadillo --- a first example}
  \lstinputlisting{code/cpp/matmult.cc}
\end{Example*}

\begin{Example*}{armadillo-compiling}{Armadillo --- compiling}
  When compiling a program using Armadillo, the library has to be
  linked with a command like
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    g++ name.cc -larmadillo
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{Example*}

\begin{Example*}{armadillo-mgs}{Armadillo --- modified Gram-Schmidt}
  \lstinputlisting{code/cpp/gram_schmidt_modified.hh}  
\end{Example*}
