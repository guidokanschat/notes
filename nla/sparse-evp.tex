\chapter{Large Sparse Eigenvalue Problems}
\label{chap:sparse-eigen}

\begin{intro}
  In this chapter we study algorithms for finding a small number
  $n_{\text{ev}}$ of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a
  large matrix $\mata\in\Rnn$, where $n$ is large, for instance
  $n>10^6$. Like in the previous chapter, this is achieved by
  projecting the problem into smaller subspaces, where we can solve
  the eigenvalue problem using the methods of the first chapter.

  Thus, we start by transferring the concept of Galerkin approximation
  from \slideref{Definition}{galerkin-method} and then use again the
  Arnoldi and Lanczos process to generate subspaces.
