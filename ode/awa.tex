\begin{Definition*}{ode}{Ordinary differential equations}
  \defindex{differential equation!ordinary|see{ordinary differential equation}} \index{ODE|see{ordinary
      differential equation}} An \define{ordinary differential
    equation} (ODE) is an equation for a function $u(t)$, defined on
  an interval $I \subset \R$ and with values in the real or complex
  numbers or in the space $\R^d$ ($\C^d$), of the form
  \begin{gather}
    F\bigl(t, u(t), u'(t), u''(t), \dots, u^{(n)}(t)\bigr) = 0.
  \end{gather}
  Here $F(\ldots)$ denotes an arbitrary function of its arguments.
  The \textbf{order}\defindex{order!of a differential equation} $n$ of
  a differential equation is the highest derivative which occurs.  If
  the dimension $d$ of the value range of $u$ is higher than one, we
  talk about systems of differential equations.
\end{Definition*}

\begin{remark}
  A differential equation, which is not ordinary, is called partial.
  These are equations or systems of equations, which involve partial
  derivatives with respect to several independent variables.  While
  the functions in an ordinary differential equation may be dependent
  on additional parameters, derivatives are only taken with respect to
  one variable, typically, but not exclusively, this variable is
  time. Due to the fact that this manuscript just deals with ordinary
  differential equations, the adjective will be omitted in the
  following.
\end{remark}

\input{definitions/explicit-ode}
\input{theorems/first-order}

\begin{proof}
  By the introduction of additional variables $u_0(t) = u(t)$, $u_1(t)
  = u'(t)$ to $u_{n-1}(t) = u^{(n-1)}(t)$, each differential equation of
  order $n$ can be transformed into a system of $n$ differential equations
  of first order. This system has the form
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:13}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u_0'(t) - u_1(t) \\
      u_1'(t) - u_2(t) \\
      \vdots\\
      u_{n-2}'(t) - u_{n-1}(t) \\
      F\bigl(t, u_0(t),u_1(t),\dots,u_{n-1}(t), u_{n-1}'(t)\bigr)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0\\0\\\vdots\\0\\0
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{gather}
  In the case of an explicit equation, the system has the form
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:13a}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u_0'(t) \\
      u_1'(t) \\
      \vdots\\
      u_{n-2}'(t) \\
      u_{n-1}' (t)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u_1(t)\\u_2(t)\\\vdots\\u_{n-1}(t)\\F\bigl(t, u_0(t),u_1(t),\dots,u_{n-1}(t)\bigr)
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{gather}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:awa:sine-1}
  The differential equation
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:17}
    u'' + \omega^2 u = f(t)
  \end{gather}
  can be transformed into the system
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:18}
    \begin{split}
      u_1' - u_2 &= 0, \\
      u_2' + \omega^2 u_1 &= f(t).
    \end{split}
  \end{gather}
  The transformation is not uniquely determined. In this example, a
  more symmetric system can be obtained:
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:18a}
    \begin{split}
      u_1' - \omega u_2 &= 0, \\
      u_2' + \omega u_1 &= f(t).
    \end{split}
  \end{gather}
  From a numerical perspective, system ~\ref{eq:awa:18a} should be
  chosen over ~\ref{eq:awa:18} to avoid loss of significance or overflow,
  i.e. if $|\omega| \ll 1$ or $|\omega| \gg 1$.
\end{example}

\begin{Definition}{autonomization}
  A differential equation of the form~\eqref{eq:awa:ode} is called
  \textbf{autonomous}, \defindex{autonomous differential equation} if
  the right hand side $f$ is not explicitly dependent on $t$, i.e.
  \begin{gather}
    u'=F(u).
  \end{gather}

  Each differential equation can be transformed into an autonomous
  differential equation.  This is called
  \textbf{autonomization}. \defindex{autonomization}
  \begin{equation*}
    U = \begin{pmatrix} u \\ t \end{pmatrix},
    \qquad
    F(U) = \begin{pmatrix} f(t,u) \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
    \qquad
    U' = F(U)
  \end{equation*}

  A method which provides the same solution for the autonomous
  differential equation as for the original IVP, is called
  \textbf{invariant under autonomization}.
\end{Definition}


Differential equations usually provide sets of solutions from which we
have to choose a solution. An important selection criteria is setting
an initial value which leads to a well-posed problem (see below).

\input{definitions/ivp}
\input{definitions/local-solution}

\begin{remark}
  We introduced the IVP deliberately in a ``local'' form because the
  local solution term is the most useful one for our purpose. Due to
  the fact that the neighborhood $J$ in the definition above can be
  arbitrarily small, we will have to deal with the extension to larger
  intervals below.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Through the substitution of $t\mapsto \tau$ with $\tau = t-t_0$ it
  is possible to transform every IVP at the point $t_0$ to a IVP in
  point $0$. We will make use of this fact and soon always assume
  $t_0 = 0$.
\end{remark}

\input{theorems/volterra}

\begin{remark}
  Both the theoretical analysis of the IVP and the numerical methods
  (with exception of the BDF methods) in this lecture notes, solve
  actually never the IVP~\eqref{eq:awa} but always the associated
  integral equation ~\eqref{eq:volterra}.
\end{remark}

\input{theorems/peano-existence}

The proof of this theorem is of little consequence for the remainder
of these notes.  For its verification, we refer to textbooks on the
theory of ordinary differential equations.

\begin{remark}
  The Peano existence theorem does not make any statements about the
  uniqueness of a solution and also just guarantees local existence.
  The second limitation is addressed by the following theorem. The
  first will be postponed to section~\ref{sec:awa:well-posedness}.
\end{remark}

\input{theorems/peano-continuation}

\begin{example}
  The IVP
  \begin{gather*}
    u' = 2 \sqrt{\lvert u \rvert}, \qquad u(0) = 0,
  \end{gather*}
  has solutions $u(t) = t^2$ and $u(t) = 0$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  The functions $1/(t-t_0)$ are solutions to the IVP
  \begin{gather*}
    u'=-u^2, \qquad u(t_0) = 1.
  \end{gather*}
\end{example}

\section{Linear differential equations
  and Gr√∂nwall's inequality}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{intro}
  The examination of linear differential equation turns out to be
  particularly simple. On the other hand, results obtained here will
  provide us with important statements for general non-linear
  IVP. Therefore we pay particular attention to the linear case.
\end{intro}

\input{definitions/linear-ode}
\input{definitions/integrating-factor}

\begin{corollary}
  The integrating factor $M(t)$ has the properties
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:awa:14}
    M(t_0) &= \identity\\
    \label{eq:awa:15}
    M'(t) &= -M(t)A(t).
  \end{align}
\end{corollary}

\input{theorems/linear-representation}

\begin{proof}
  We consider the auxiliary function $w(t) = M(t) u(t)$ with the
  integrating factor $M(t)$ of the equation~\eqref{eq:awa:7}. Using the
  product rule, there holds
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:19}
    w'(t) =  M(t) u'(t) + M'(t) u(t)
    =  M(t) u'(t) - M(t)A(t)u(t).
  \end{gather}
  Comparing this to the differential equation~\eqref{eq:awa:5}, we see
  that $w$ solves
  \begin{gather*}
    w'(t) = M(t) b(t).
  \end{gather*}
	This can be integrated directly to obtain	
  \begin{gather*}
    w(t) = u_0 + \int_{t_0}^t M(s) b(s) \ds,
  \end{gather*}
  where we use that $w(t_0) = u_0$.  According to
  lemma~\ref{Lemma:appendix:exp-1} about the \putindex{matrix
    exponential}, $M(t)$ is invertible for all $t$.  With the
  definition of $w(t)$ we are therefore able to solve for $u(t)$,
  which results in the equation~\eqref{eq:awa:8}. The global
  solvability follows from the fact that the solution is defined for
  arbitrary $t\in \R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:awa:sine-2}
  The equation in example~\ref{ex:awa:sine-1} is linear and can be
  written in the form of~\eqref{eq:awa:4} with
  \begin{align*}
    A(t) = A &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & \omega \\ -\omega & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \\
    b(t) &= f(t).
  \end{align*}
  Let now $f(t) \equiv 0$. The Jordan canonical form of $A$ is
  \begin{gather*}
    A = C^{-1}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \omega i \\ & -\omega i
    \end{pmatrix}
    C
  \end{gather*}
  with a suitable transformation matrix $C$. The integrating factor is
  \begin{gather*}
    M(t) = e^{At} = C^{-1}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      e^{\omega i} \\ & e^{-\omega i}
    \end{pmatrix} C
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \cos \omega t & \sin \omega t \\
      -\sin \omega t & \cos \omega t
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{gather*}
  Thus, given an initial value $(u_0, v_0)^T$, the solution is
  \begin{gather*}
    u(t) =  \begin{pmatrix}
      \cos \omega t & \sin \omega t \\
      -\sin \omega t & \cos \omega t
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u_0\\v_0
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{gather*}
  The missing details in this argument and the case for an
  inhomogenety $f(t) = \cos \alpha t$ are left as an exercise.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
  If the function $b(t)$ in~\eqref{eq:awa:5} is only integrable, the
  function $u(t)$ defined in~\eqref{eq:awa:8} is absolutely continuous
  and thus differentiable almost everywhere. The chain
  rule~\eqref{eq:awa:19} is applicable in all points of
  differentiability and $w(t)$ solves the Volterra integral equation
  corresponding to~\eqref{eq:awa:4}. Thus, the representation
  formula~\eqref{eq:awa:8} holds generally for solutions of linear
  Volterra integral equations.
\end{remark}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input{theorems/gronwall}
\begin{proof}
  Using the integrating factor
  \begin{gather*}
    m(t) = \exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^t a(s) \ds\right),
    \quad
    \frac1{m(t)} = \exp\left(\int_{t_0}^t a(s) \ds\right),
  \end{gather*}
  we introduce the auxiliary function
  \begin{gather*}
    v(t) = m(t) % \exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^t a(s) \ds\right)
    \int_{t_0}^t a(s)w(s)\ds,
  \end{gather*}
  This function is absolutely continuous and almost everywhere
  \begin{gather*}
    v'(t) = m(t) a(t) %\exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^t a(s) \ds\right)
    \left[
      w(t) - \int_{t_0}^t a(s) w(s) \ds
    \right].
  \end{gather*}
  By assumption~\eqref{eq:awa:10}, the bracket on the right is bounded
  by $b(t)$. Thus,
  \begin{gather*}
    v'(t) \le m(t) a(t) b(t) %\exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^t a(s) \ds\right),
  \end{gather*}
  and since $v(t_0) = 0$ by its definition,
  \begin{gather*}
    v(t) \le \int_{t_0}^t m(s) a(s) b(s) % \exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^s a(r)
    \ds.
  \end{gather*}
  From the definition of $v(t)$, we obtain
  \begin{gather*}
    \int_{t_0}^t a(s)w(s)\ds = \frac1{m(t)} % \exp\left(\int_{t_0}^t a(s) \ds\right)
    v(t)
    \le \frac1{m(t)} \int_{t_0}^t m(s)a(s)b(s) \ds
    % \exp\left( %\int_{t_0}^t a(r) \dr
    %   - \int_{t_0}^s a(r) \dr\right)\ds
  \end{gather*}
  Finally, since $b(t)$ is nondecreasing we obtain almost everywhere
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{t_0}^t a(s)w(s)\ds
    &\le  \frac{b(t)}{m(t)} \int_{t_0}^t a(s)
    \exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^s a(r) \dr\right)\ds
    \\
    &= \frac{b(t)}{m(t)} \left[-
    \exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^s a(r) \dr\right)
      \right]_{t_0}^t
    \\
    &= \frac{b(t)}{m(t)} \bigl(m(t_0)-m(t)\bigr)
      = \frac{b(t)}{m(t)} - b(t)
  \end{align*}
  Now, entering into the integral inequality~\eqref{eq:awa:10}, we
  obtain
  \begin{gather*}
    w(t) \le b(t) + \int_{t_0}^t a(s)w(s)\ds = \frac{b(t)}{m(t)},
  \end{gather*}
  which proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{remark}
	On the form of the requirements~\eqref{eq:awa:10} as well as the
  estimation~\eqref{eq:awa:11}, we can see that Gr√∂nwall's
  inequality is basically based on the construction of a majorant for 
	$w(t)$, which satisfies a linear IVP.
\end{remark}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{Corollary}{awa:unique-linear}
  Let the functions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ be two solutions of the linear
  differential equation~\eqref{eq:awa:5}. If both functions
  coincide in a point $t_0$ then they are identical.
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
	The difference $w(t) = v(t) - u(t)$ solves the integral equation
  \begin{gather*}
    w(t) = \int_{t_0}^t A(s) w(s) \ds.
  \end{gather*}
  Hence $|w(t)|$ satisfies the integral inequality
  \begin{gather*}
    |w(t)| \le \int_{t_0}^t |A(s)| |w(s)| \ds,
  \end{gather*}
	from which we conclude with Gr√∂nwall's inequality~\eqref{eq:awa:11} 
	for $b(t) = 0$, that $|w(t)|=0$ for all $t$ and therefore
  $u(t) = v(t)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  The representation formula~\eqref{eq:awa:8} in
  Lemma~\ref{Lemma:linear-representation} defines the unique solution to the
  IVP~\eqref{eq:awa:4}. In particular, solutions of linear IVP are
  always defined on the whole real axis.
\end{corollary}

\begin{example}
  Let $A \in \C^{d\times d}$ be diagonalizable with possibly repeated
  eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_d$ and corresponding
  eigenvectors $\psi^{(i)}$. Let $\Psi$ be the matrix of column
  vectors $\psi^{(i)}$. Then, the solution of the IVP
  \begin{gather*}
    \begin{split}
      u' &= A u,\\
      u(0) &= u_0,
    \end{split}
  \end{gather*}
  is given by the formula
  \begin{gather*}
    u(t) = e^{At} u_0 = \Psi \exp
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \lambda_1\\&\ddots\\&&\lambda_d
    \end{pmatrix}
    \Psi^{-1} u_0.
  \end{gather*}
  This is due to the fact, that $M(t) = e^{-At}$ and $e^{-\Psi A
    \psi^{-1}t} = \Psi e^{-At} \Psi^{-1}$.
\end{example}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{Lemma}{solution-space}
  \index{homogeneous}
  \index{ordinary differential equation!linear!homogeneous}
  The solutions of the homogeneous, linear differential equation
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:9}
    u'(t) = A(t) u(t)
  \end{gather}
  with $u:\R\to\R^d$, define a vector space of dimension $d$. Let
  $\{\psi^{(i)}\}_{i=1,\dots,d}$ be a basis of $\R^d$. 
	Then the solutions $\phi^{(i)}(t)$ of the equation~\eqref{eq:awa:9} with 
  initial values $\phi^{(i)}(0) = \psi^{(i)}$ form a basis of the solution
  space. The vectors $\{\phi^{(i)}(t)\}$ are linear independent
  for all $t\in \R$.
\end{Lemma}


\begin{proof}
  At first we observe that for two solutions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ of the
  equation~\eqref{eq:awa:9}, their sum and their scalar multiples are
  solutions too, due to linearity \index{linear} of the derivative
  and the right hand side.  Therefore the vector space structure is
  proven.
 
  Let now $\phi^{(i)}(t)$ be solutions of the IVP with linear
  independent initial values $\{\psi^{(i)}\}$.  As a consequence the
  functions are linear independent as well.

  Assume that $w(t)$ is a solution of the equation~\eqref{eq:awa:9},
  which cannot be written as a linear combination of $\psi^{(i)}$.
  Then $w(0)$ is not a linear combination of the vectors $\psi^{(i)}$:
  else let's say $w(0) = \sum \alpha_i \psi^{(i)}$, then
  $w(t) = \sum \alpha_i \phi^{(i)}(t)$ would be a linear combination
  because of uniqueness proven in
  corollary~\ref{Corollary:awa:unique-linear}.  Since $\{\psi^{(i)}\}$
  according to the assumtions is a basis of $\R^d$, such a $w(0)$
  cannot exist.  Hence it is shown that $\phi^{(i)}(t)$ is a basis of
  the solution space of dimension $d$.
  
  It remains to show that the $\phi^{(i)}(t)$ are linearly independent
  for all $t\in \R$. To this end, assume that the set $\phi^{(i)}(t)$
  is linearly dependent for a value $t_1$.  Then the following holds
  true without loss of generality
  \begin{gather*}
    \phi^{(d)}(t_1) = \sum_{i=1}^{d-1}\alpha_i\phi^{(i)}(t_1) =: w(t).
  \end{gather*}
  Again according to corollary~\ref{Corollary:awa:unique-linear} we
  have $\phi^{(d)} \equiv w$, moreover $\phi^{(d)}(0) = w(0)$ which
  again is a contradiction to the assumption $\psi^{(d)}$ is a linear
  combination of the other initial values.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\input{definitions/fundamental-system}

\begin{Corollary}{fundamental-regular}
  The fundamental matrix is regular for all $t\in \R$ and solves the
  IVP
  \begin{align*}
    \fundam'(t) &= A(t)\fundam(t)\\
    \fundam (0) &= \identity.
  \end{align*}
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
  The initial value is part of the definition. On the other hand,
  splitting the the matrix valued IVP into its column vectors, we
  obtain the original IVP defining the solution space. Regularity
  follows from linear independence of solutions for any $t$.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Well-posedness of the IVP}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:awa:well-posedness}


\input{definitions/hadamard}

\begin{example}
  The IVP
  \begin{gather*}
    u'= \sqrt[3]{u}, \qquad u(0) = 0,
  \end{gather*}
  has solutions of the form
  \begin{gather*}
    u(t) =
    \begin{cases}
      0 \\
      c \left(\tfrac23t\right)^{3/2}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{gather*}
  Thus, the solution is not unique and therefore, the IVP is not
  well-posed.
  Let now the initial value be nonzero, but slightly positive. Then, a small
  perturbation, which changes its sign, will have dramatic effect on
  the solution.
\end{example}

\begin{Definition}{Lipschitz-condition}
  The function $f(t,y)$ satisfies on its domain $D = I\times\Omega \subset
  \R \times \R^d$ an uniformly continuous \define{Lipschitz condition} if 
	it is Lipschitz continuous with regard to $y$, i.e., it exists a 
	positive constant $L$, such that
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:1}
    \forall t\in I;\,x,y\in\Omega \;:\;
    \abs{f(t,x)-f(t,y)} \le L \abs{x-y}
  \end{gather}
  It satisfies a local Lipschitz condition if the same holds true for all 
  compact subsets of $D$.
\end{Definition}


\begin{example}
  Let $f(t,u)\in C^1(\R \times\R^d )$ and let all partial derivatives
  with respect to components of $u$ be bounded by
  \begin{gather*}
    \max_{\substack{t\in \R\\u\in \R^d\\1\le i,j \le d}}
   \abs{
     \frac{\partial}{\partial u_i} f_j(t,u)
   } \le K.
  \end{gather*}
  Then, $f$ satisfies the Lipschitz condition~\eqref{eq:awa:1} with
  $L=K$. Indeed, by using Taylor expansion, we see that
  \begin{multline*}
    f_j(t, u) - f_j(t,v)
    = \int_0^1 \frac{d}{ds}f_j\bigl(t,u+s(v-u)\bigr)\ds\\
    = \int_0^1 \sum_{i=1}^d(u_i-v_i)\partial_if_j\bigl(t,u+s(v-u)\bigr)\ds.
  \end{multline*}
  It is an easy conclusion that
  \begin{gather*}
    \abs{f(t,u)-f(t,v)}
    \le K \abs{u-v}.
  \end{gather*}
\end{example}


\input{theorems/stability}

\begin{proof}
  Both $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ solve their respective Volterra integral
  equations. Taking the difference, we obtain
  \begin{align*}
    u(t)-v(t) &= u_0-v_0
           + \int_{t_0}^t \bigl[ f(s,u(s)) - g(s,v(s)) \bigr]\ds
    \\
         &= u_0-v_0
           + \int_{t_0}^t \bigl[ f(s,u(t)) - f(s,v(s)) \bigr]\ds
           + \int_{t_0}^t \bigl[ f(s,v(t)) - g(s,v(s)) \bigr]\ds.
  \end{align*}
  Thus, its norm admits the integral inequality
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{u(t)-v(t)}
    &\le \abs{u_0-v_0} + \int_{t_0}^t\abs{f(s,u(t)) - f(s,v(s))} \ds
    + \int_{t_0}^t \abs{f(s,v(t)) - g(s,v(s))} \ds
    \\
    &\le \underbrace{\abs{u_0-v_0}
      + \int_{t_0}^t \max_{x\in\Omega} \abs{f(s,x)-g(s,x)}\ds}_{b(t)}
      + \int_{t_0}^t L \abs{u(s)-v(s)} \ds.
  \end{align*}
  This inequality is in the form of the assumption in Gr√∂nwall's
  lemma, and its application yields the stability result.
\end{proof}


\input{theorems/picard-lindelof}

\begin{proof}
  First, we assume for simplicity $t_0=0$ or we transform the problem
  accordingly. Abbreviate $I = [-T,T]$ and
  \begin{gather*}
    \Omega = \bigl\{x\in \R^d\big| \abs{x-u_0} \le b \bigr\}.
  \end{gather*}

  We introduce the operator $F(u)$ which is defined
  through the \putindex{Volterra integral
    equation}~\eqref{eq:volterra} as
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:awa:16}
   F(u)(t) = u_0 + \int\limits_{0}^t f(s,u(s)) \ds.
  \end{gather}
  Obviously $u$ is a solution of the Volterra integral
  equation~\eqref{eq:volterra} if and only if $u$ is a \putindex{fixed
    point} of $F$ i.e., $u=Fu$. We can obtain such a fixed-point by
  the iteration $u^{(k+1)} = F(u^{(k)})$ with some initial guess
  $u^{(0)}:I\to\Omega$. From the boundedness of $f$, we obtain for
  $t-t_0 \le T$
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{u^{(k+1)}(t)-u_0} = \abs[big]{\int_{t_0}^t f(s,u^{(k)}(s))\ds } \le \int_{t_0}^t
    \abs{f(s,u^{(k)}(s))}\ds \le TM \le b.
  \end{align*}
  Thus, from $u^{(0)}:I\to\Omega$ follows $u^{(k)}:I\to\Omega$ for all
  $k$ and the iteration is well-defined.
  
  We now show that $F$ is a contraction under the assumtions of the
  theorem. We follow the technique
  in~\cite[\S117]{Heuser86} and choose on the space $\mathcal C(I)$,
  which is the space of the continuous functions on $I$, the norm
  \begin{gather*}
    \norm{u}_e := \underset{t \in I}{max} ~e^{-2 L t} |u(t)|.
  \end{gather*}
  
  With estimating the difference of operator $F$ applied to two functions:
  \begin{align*}
    |F(u)(t) - F(v)(t)|
    & = \left| u_0 - u_0 + \int\limits_{0}^t (f(s,u(s)) - f(s,v(s))) \ds \right| \\
    & \le \int\limits_{0}^t \left| f\bigl(s,u(s)\bigr) - f\bigl((s,v(s)\bigr) \right| \ds \\
    & \le \int\limits_{0}^t L |u(s) - v(s)| \underbrace{e^{-2 L s} e^{2 L s}}_{= 1} \ds \\
    & \le L \norm{u-v}_e \int\limits_{0}^t e^{2 L s} \ds \\
    & = L \norm{u-v}_e \frac{e^{2 L t} - 1}{2 L} \\
    & \le \frac12 e^{2 L t} \norm{u-v}_e.
  \end{align*}

  It follows   
  \begin{gather*}
    e^{-2 L t}|F(u)(t) - F(v)(t)| \le \frac12 \norm{u-v}_e,
  \end{gather*}
  for all $t$ and we observe:
  \begin{gather*}
    |F(u)(t) - F(v)(t)|_e \le \frac12 \norm{u-v}_e.
  \end{gather*}
  Thus, we have shown that $F$ is a contraction on the space of the
  continuous functions with the norm $\norm{.}_e$.  Therefore, we can apply
  the \putindex{Banach fixed-point theorem}, concluding that $F$ has
  exactly one fixed-point. This proves the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  The norm $\norm{u}_e$ had been chosen with regard to Gr√∂nwall's
  inequality, which was not used in the proof explicitly.  It is
  equivalent to the norm $\norm{u}_\infty$ because $e^{-2 L t}$ is strictly
  positiv and bounded. On the other hand one could have performed the
  proof with some more calculations with respect to the ordinary
  Tchebychev distance (maximum norm) $\norm{u}_\infty$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Currently our solution is restricted to $I = [t_0 - T, t_0 + T]$.
  Since $T$ is chosen in such a way in
  equation~\ref{Theorem:picardlindelof} that the graph of $u$ does not
  leave the domain, this extension always ends on the boundary of
  $D$. One can now extend the solution by solving the next IVP
  $\left\{\begin{array}{l}
            u' = f(t,u)\\
            u(t_1) = u_1\\
  \end{array}\right\}$
	on the interval $I_1$. This way one obtains a solution on
 $I \cup I_1 \cup I_2 \cup ...$.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
  Let the function $f(t,u)$ admit the Lipschitz condition on $\R\times
  \C^d$. Then, the IVP has a unique solution on the whole real axis.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  The boundedness was used in order to guarantee that $u(t)\in \Omega$
  for any $t$. This is not necessary anymore, if $\Omega =
  \C^d$. Thus, the limitation of the interval $I$ becomes unnecessary
  as well. Finally, the fixed point argument does not depend on
  boundedness of the set.
\end{proof}
% \begin{theorem}[Differential stability]
%   In addition to the assumptions of the Picard-Lindel√∂f theorem, let
%   the gradient of $f$ with respect to its second argument, $\nabla_u
%   f(t,u)$ exist and be continuous in $D$. Then, the solution of the
%   IVP depends continuously on the initial value $u_0$ and the gradient
%   of the solution $u$ with respect to $u_0$ solves the IVP
%   \begin{gather}
%     \label{eq:awa:23}
%     \begin{split}
%     (\nabla_{u_0} u)' &= \nabla_u f(t,u) \nabla_{u_0} u,
%     \\
%     \nabla_{u_0} u(t_0) &= \mathbb I.
%     \end{split}
%   \end{gather}
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{example}
% 	It exists a solution of the IVP
%     $\left\{\begin{array}{l}
%       u'=\sin(u)\\
%       u(0)=7\\
%     \end{array}\right\}$?

%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item The IVP is autonomous.
%     \item $|\sin(u)| \le 1$
%     \item $\sin(u)$ satisfies the Lipschitz condition with $L=1$.
%     \item $D = \R \times \R$
%   \end{enumerate}

%   $\Rightarrow$ Due to the theorems of Peano~\eqref{satz:peano} and Picard-Lindel√∂f~\eqref{Theorem:picardlindelof} it follows:
%   $\exists! u : \R \to \R$
% \end{example}

% \begin{example}
%   $\left\{\begin{array}{l}
%     u'(t) = -u^2\\
%     u(-1) = 1\\
%   \end{array}\right\}$

%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item $u^2$ is continuous in $\R$.
%     \item However we just have a local Lipschitz condition.
%   \end{enumerate}
%   \noindent $\Rightarrow$ $u(t) = \frac1t$ auf $(-\infty,0)$
% \end{example}

% \begin{example}
%   $\left\{\begin{array}{l}
%     u' = \lambda u\\
%     u(0) = u_0\\
%   \end{array}\right\}$

% 	\begin{enumerate}
%   \item $\lambda u$ is Lipschitz continuous on $\R$
% 	\end{enumerate}

%   \noindent $\Rightarrow e^{\lambda t} u_0$ is the unique solution in $\R$.
